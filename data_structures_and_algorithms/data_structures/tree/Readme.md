## Code Challenge: Class 15: Binary Tree and BST Implementation
### Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Create a BinaryTree class
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

## Code Challenge: Class 16 find-maximum-binary-tree
### Challenge
- Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Code Challenge: Class 17

# Challenge Summary
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach.

## Challenge Description
- return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big(o) ===> O(N)
